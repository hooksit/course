  <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
  <h3>Down the Rabbit-Hollo</h3>
  <p class="first">
    Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or
    twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what
    is the use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures or conversations?”</p>
  <p>
    So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid),
    whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when
    suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.</p>
  <p><strong>
      There was nothing</strong> so <em>very</em> <mark>remarkable</mark> in that; nor did Alice think it so very much
    out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over
    afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite
    natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried
    on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a
    waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and
    fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a <span class="marked">large rabbit-hole under the hedge.</span></p>
